        <br><h2>What is an AI Assistant?</h2></br>
        <p>An AI assistant is a virtual agent that leverages natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and sometimes even voice recognition to help users perform tasks or retrieve information. They are capable of understanding and processing human language to execute commands, answer questions, and provide recommendations. Their advanced algorithms allow them to improve and become more accurate with use, learning from each interaction.</p>

       <br> <h2>How AI Assistants Work</h2></br>
        <p>AI assistants rely heavily on large datasets, complex algorithms, and neural networks to process user inputs and respond appropriately. When a user interacts with an AI assistant, the system interprets the request through NLP, searches for relevant information, and provides a solution or action. Machine learning helps the assistant to improve over time, tailoring its responses and actions based on previous interactions.
